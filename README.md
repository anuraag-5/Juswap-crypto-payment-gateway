# Juswap (Without Jupiter api key)

This is the project which does not use `JUPITER_API_KEY` as i cannot afford 300 USDC a month üôè , as a result due to rate limiting factors the swap api may fail from JUPITER side.

## Juswap-2 (API-Key Enabled)

**I have created the same project twice here [Juswap-2](https://github.com/anuraag-5/Juswap-2)**, the difference is that just you can now also pass env of `NEXT_PUBLIC_JUPITER_API_KEY` your own jupiter api key, so that this will 100% work.
