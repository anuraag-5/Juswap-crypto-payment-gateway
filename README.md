## Juswap (Read carefully)

This is the project which does not use `JUPITER_API_KEY` as i cannot afford 300 USDC a month üôè , as a result due to rate limiting factors the swap api may fail from JUPITER side. Although for your first look and testing i have deployed the project at [Juswap](https://juswap.vercel.app). But i recommend for fully testing Read below.


## Juswap-2 (API-Key Enabled)

**I have created the same project twice here [Juswap-2](https://github.com/anuraag-5/Juswap-2)**, the difference is just that i have dockerized this app and you can now pass `JUPITER_API_KEY` environment variable to fully test my app.
