## Juswap (Read carefully)

This is the project which does not use `JUPITER_API_KEY` as i cannot afford 300 USDC a month üôè , as a result due to rate limiting factors the swap api may fail from JUPITER side. Although for your first look and testing i have deployed the project at [Juswap](https://juswap.vercel.app). 
<br>

Connect your wallet on my website and then send token from other wallet to this wallet and then wait for max `15 seconds` for it to detect the token and swap.

<br>

But i recommend for fully testing and checking the swap read below.


## Juswap-2 (API-Key Enabled)

**I have created the same project twice here [Juswap-2](https://github.com/anuraag-5/Juswap-2/blob/main/README.md)**, the difference is just that i have dockerized this app and you can now pass `JUPITER_API_KEY` environment variable to fully test my app.
